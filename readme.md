# EnergyLocal Community Energy Dashboard

Energy Local : Ynni Lleol is a community project linking up households with community hydro, wind & solar power projects.

## EnergyLocal Dashboard [https://dashboard.energylocal.org.uk](https://dashboard.energylocal.org.uk)

The EnergyLocal Dashboard is a mobile friendly dashboard also packaged as an android and iOS app that shows when it is a good time to use electricity.

## Documentation (Old! needs to be updated)

We have moved away from the idea of hosting the whole dashboard on the local hub (as discussed in the documentation below).
The home hub is now mostly a standard OpenEnergyMonitor emonBase which has the demandshaper module installed as standard.
